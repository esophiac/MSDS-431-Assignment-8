# Assignment Week 8 - Modern Applied Statistics with Go
Text

describe your efforts in finding R and Go packages for the method

Review your process of building the Go implementation

Review your experiences with testing, benchmarking, software profiling, and logging

## Background
Andrew Gelamn and Aki Vehrati wrote the article, “What Are the Most Important Statistical Ideas of the Past 50 Years?" which provides a list of significant statistical ideas and how they relate to modern computing and exploratory data analysis. Based on the article, bootstrapping was identified as a method of testing the performance of Go and R due to its significance in  modern applied statistics.

## Recommendation to Management
How easy is it to use Go in place of R? How much money will the firm save in cloud computing costs?

Under what circumstances would it make sense for the firm to use Go in place of R for the selected statistical method?

Select a cloud provider of infrastructure as a service (IaS).

Note the cloud costs for virtual machine (compute engine) services. What percentage of cloud computing costs might be saved with a move from R to Go?

## Roles of Programs and Data
These are the programs in the repository. Data information is in the background section.

- Go
    - main.go: runs the bootstrapping program
- R
    - R_logs.txt: logs for exploring the memory and time requirements of bootstrapping
    - R_week_8.R: R file used to explore the memory and time requirements of bootstrapping
- README.md:
